# Chrome Lighthouse user flows as GitHub action

This repository maintains a GitHub action to run [@push-based/user-flow](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow) in a workflow.
It automatically detects flows, executes them and produces md reports as comments in your PR.

| **`--commentId`**            | `string`  | `user flow summary report`  | Id used to identify a comment in the PR (useful if multiple actions run user-flow for the same PR)  |  
| **`--commentsOnly`**         | `string`  | `off`                       | Only collects results and creates a comment in the PR (helpful if the reports are generated over external logic)                    |

| **`...`**                    |  ...      | ...                         | All other actions from the user-flow CLI are available                                                     |  

# Setup

1. Create a file called `user-flow-ci.yml` in `./.github/workflows`.

This can be done by using the `init`:  
`npx @push-based/user-flow init --generateGhWorkflow`  

2. The generated `user-flow-ci.yml` file should have the following content:

```yml
name: user-flow-ci
on:
  pull_request:
jobs:
  user-flow-integrated-in-ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Executing user-flow CLI
        # without any parameters the rcPath defaults to `.user-flowrc.json`
        uses: push-based/user-flow-gh-action@v0.1.0
```

You can use action inputs over the with property:

```yml
name: user-flow-ci
on:
  pull_request:
jobs:
  user-flow-integrated-in-ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Executing user-flow CLI
        # without any parameters the rcPath defaults to `.user-flowrc.json`
        uses: push-based/user-flow-gh-action@v0.1.0
        with:
          commentId: test-e2e-first-run
          dryRun: off
          verbose: on
          url: https://google.com
          ufPath: ./user-flows
          outPath: ./packages/user-flow-gh-action-e2e/measures
          format: html,json
          rcPath: ./.user-flowrc.json
```


# How to test the setup

1. If you open a new PR in your repository you should see the runner execution your user-flow in the CI

2. After the user flow executed you should see a mark down report as comment attached to your PR

# How to use it with the nx-plugin and --affected

If you use Nx as you tooling choice you should consider our [Nx plugin](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/tree/main/packages/nx-plugin) for [user-flow](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow).

Here is how you can combine it with the GitHub action:

1. Use the action with commentsOnly. besides the outPath no other params are considered.
```yml
  name: user-flow-ci
  on:
    pull_request:
  jobs:
    user-flow-integrated-in-ci:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      strategy:
        matrix:
          node-version: [18.x]
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Executing user-flow CLI
          uses: push-based/user-flow-gh-action@v0.1.0
          with:
            verbose: on
            commentId: test-e2e-first-run
            commentsOnly: on
```
